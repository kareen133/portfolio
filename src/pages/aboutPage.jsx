<h3>My Journey</h3>
<p>
I believe in the power of design and code to solve problems and enhance the way we 
interact with technology. My mission is to build websites that are not only look great but
 also accessible and easy to use for everyone.
My journey into web development started with a curiosity 
about how websites were built ,and how i can translate my ui designs into real website . What began as a hobby quickly turned into a passion, 
and I began to teach myself HTML and CSS. As I delved deeper, I discovered the joy of 
creating interactive elements with JavaScript, and from there, I expanded my skillset to include
 React. Every project Iâ€™ve undertaken has been a step forward in refining my skills and understanding
  the intricacies of web design.
